                <p> Mardi Gras' holiday is celebrated throughout Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. The
                    festivities are concentrated for about two weeks before and during the week of Pentecost, the day
                    before Ash Wednesday (the beginning of borrowing in the Western Christian tradition). There is
                    usually one big parade each day (weather permitting); Many days there are some big processions. The
                    biggest and most complex parades take place in the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the
                    past week, many events have taken place throughout New Orleans and nearby communities, including
                    processions and balls (some of them masquerade).
                    <br>
                </p>
                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs called Cruises; Most of them follow the
                schedule of the same parade and route each year. The early Krewes based were the Krewe Mistick of
                Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Mummus and the Krewe of Proteus. Some modern
                "super-caravans" are known for holding big parades and events, such as Carva from Andimion (known
                mainly for celebrity names as great marshals for their processions), Carva from a cup (also known as
                celebrities by the name of their kings), as well as the Zulu Auxiliary Club -American mostly krewe.
                Floating riders traditionally throw shots into the crowds.<br>The most common injections are strings
                of colored, double plastic beads, decorated plastic "injection cups," moon pies, and small cheap
                toys, but injections can also include lingerie and fainter items. Large groups keep track of the
                procession and route schedule each year.While many tourists center their carnival season activities
                on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans Dauphin, large processions originated in the Uptown and
                Mid-City counties and operated a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upstream
                side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally ends with a "court meeting" between Rex and
                Komus.
