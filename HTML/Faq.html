            <div id="qu1" class="qu">When does Mardi Gras start and end?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an1" class="an">The carnival season always begins on January 6, which is King's Day. Mardi Gras
                    (Fat Tuesday), on the other hand, is a different day each year.Tuesday The oil changes every year
                    because Easter Sunday is never the same Sunday every year. Oil Tuesday is always the day before Ash
                    Wednesday.Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday before Mardi Gras and stay until
                    Ash Wednesday.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="qu2" class="qu">Is there Mardi Gras "official"?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an2" class="an">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to
                    everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses that offer "official" merchandise from Mardi Gras
                    or the "official" Mardi Gras website. The use of the term "official" is just a way for vendors to
                    sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not
                    licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each single parade is responsible for all its
                    merchandise. In some parts of the state, official organizations control their Mardi Gras
                    celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

            <div id="qu3" class="qu">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an3" class="an">The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very hot, almost hot.
                    Sometimes this will change from one end to the other during the same day. It is advisable to lay
                    down the clothes as a cold morning can turn into a hot afternoon.
                    Because you will spend long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that may get a little
                    dirty. Do not forget to check the forecast for rain. If you forecast storms then you will definitely
                    want to bring a raincoat!
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="qu4" class="qu">Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades pass by?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an4" class="an">The best option is to book a package in the French Quarter or along the parade
                    route that offers a terrace, food and a toilet ticket.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="qu5" class="qu"> How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an5" class="an">It's free! Not only that, but you will come out with bags of Mardi Gras shot
                    beads. That's why we call it "the greatest free show on the planet!"
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="qu6" class="qu">I only have a limited time. What is the best time to visit during Mardi Gras?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an6" class="an">The weekend before the fat Tuesday is the time to visit Mardi Gras in New
                    Orleans. This is the weekend when Bachus and Andimion, the two big parades of the season, roll
                    through the streets of New Orleans. The streets are busy all day on Saturday and Sunday with parade
                    guards. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundy Gra) and Fat Tuesday are also great
                    days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
                    Lundy Gra festival continues all day. On a fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing
                    all the costumes and masks is a unique and fascinating experience.

            <div id="qu7" class="qu">What happens if there is bad weather?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an7" class="an">The parades roll in light rain. Officials will only reject if the weather
                    forecast is difficult. Local TV and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast hourly
                    updates.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="qu8" class="qu">Can I bring my children to Mardi Gras?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an8" class="an">In every way, yes! Contrary to popular belief, Mardi Gras is a family
                    celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our kids have grown up and we
                    keep going to every parade because we used to use the “take the kids” patch! Bring large bags (even
                    large garbage bags!) To hold all the things they will grab. Injections often include toys, stuffed
                    animals, beads and more.
                    It is recommended to take your children to parades in suburban areas like Matayar, which is 10
                    minutes away.

            <div id="qu9" class="qu">What are the best ways to get around New Orleans after I arrive?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an9" class="an">The best transportation methods will be through taxi / car sharing services,
                    tram or rental car, depending on where you are staying. Driving your vehicle and finding parking
                    spaces will be difficult.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="qu10" class="qu">Why is Mardi Gras set on different dates each year?
                <img src="../Images/icon.png" class="open">
                <div id="an10" class="an">Mardi Gras' date changes each year as it is connected to Easter, which can
                    take place every Sunday from March 23 to April 25. Mardi Gras Day always takes place 47 days before
                    Easter.
